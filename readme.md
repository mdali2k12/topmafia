# app' memo

## run the project on local environment (guidelines for Windows10)
- prerequisites are:
    * having git installed on your machine
    * having PHP 7.4 installed and configured on your machine
    * having **Composer** installed on your machine (you can get it here => https://getcomposer.org/download/ ) and availabe in your system PATH
    * having MariaDB installed and running on port 3306 on your machine
    * having XAMPP installed on your machine
- replace the contents of the **[xampp_install_directory]\xampp\php\php.ini** file (or create the file if not exists) with the contents of the **php.ini** file that is located at the root of this project
- on your **httpd** configuration file located in **[xampp_install_directory]\xampp\apache\conf** folder, uncomment the line (by removing the **#** character at the start of the line) containing **Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf**; this is necessary to allow your Apache virtual host to be configured
- at the end of the **[xampp_install_directory]\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf** file, paste the Apache directives (without the backticks) that you'll find below in this readme
- at the end of the **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc** file, add the line ```127.0.0.1 topmafia.net.localhost``` (without any backticks)
- put the the contents of this project into a folder called **topmafia**, which will be located in **[xampp_install_directory]\xampp\htdocs**, DONT WRAP THE FILES IN ANOTHER SUBFOLDER, just put them as they are in the aformentioned **topmafia** folder
- using your MariaDB database manager (like **phpmyadmin**, **DBeaver**, or **HeidiSQL**), run the sql\init_db_dev.sql script to initialize database, MariaDB user, and necessary tables
- replace the ./API/.env file placeholder values with the relevant values corresponding to your environment
    * for Google Recaptcha, you'll need to create a recaptcha V3 validator using this form => https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create , while being connected to your Google account; the domain you'll add will be called **topmafia.net.localhost**; as to the 3 checkboxes at the bottom of the recaptcha creation form, just check the first and the third one and then submit your form; when checking on the settings of your newly created recaptcha, you can get access to the recaptcha keys to copy and paste them at the relevant place in your **.env** file
    * you'll need to follow similar procedures for SendGrid (you can manage your keys your SendGrid keys using https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys, your SendGrid sender email can be configured here => https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) and Facebook API's 
- with a terminal open at the **API** folder of the project run ```composer install``` to install necessary dependencies
- start your Apache server with XAMPP (and optionally the MySQL one if you use the XAMPP database) and go to **topmafia.net.localhost** in your browser (give me a call if not working)
- to keep on working on the Angular app', go to the **frontend** folder and run ```npm install``` and then ```ng serve --open``` to run the under construction SPA (you must have the Angular cli installed on your system to do this)

## Apache
### localhost on XAMPP

```

## API routes
- **/** 
    * home route
- **/apptokens** 
    * endpoint for handling app' tokens
- **/emails** 
    * endpoint for trigerring app' emails (including account verification and reset password)
- **/sessions** 
    * route to login and signout a user, a POST request will create a session (e.g. signing the user in), a DELETE request will log out the user (e.g. delete the session)
- **/users** 
    * route that handles **users** entity, a POST request to that route will create a user


## current workflow : SPA / test app' live / Facebook login

            * implement recaptcha 
                - validation feedback => "Google says you're a robot ðŸ¤–"
            * looping through server validation feedbacks to adapt at controller and form level
            * test user creation
            * sponsorship
                - prefill sponsor ID if $_GET["sponsorid"] exists

            * loading spinner on sending form
    * refactor login-signup-shell.component.scss
        - remove unnecessary code
    * âœ… implement drawer menu navigation routes or simili-routes

- migrate the auto login logic to the Angular app'
    * also implement it after registration
### overall app' testing live
### Facebook login
- needs HTTPS ! therefore we need to deploy app' as is in an online server pointed by a SSL protected domaine name
